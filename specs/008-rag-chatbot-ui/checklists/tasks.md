# Task Quality Checklist: Integrate FastAPI RAG Chatbot UI

**Purpose**: Validate task list completeness and quality before proceeding to implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-01
**Feature**: [./../spec.md](specs/008-rag-chatbot-ui/spec.md)
**Plan**: [./../plan.md](specs/008-rag-chatbot-ui/plan.md)
**Tasks**: [./../tasks.md](specs/008-rag-chatbot-ui/tasks.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] All tasks align with the feature specification and implementation plan
- [x] Each task has a unique ID (TSK-XXX)
- [x] Task descriptions are clear, concise, and actionable
- [x] No implementation details leak into task descriptions (focus on *what* to do, not *how*)

## Task Completeness

- [x] All functional requirements from the spec are covered by at least one task
- [x] All architectural decisions from the plan are addressed by relevant tasks
- [x] Each task has clear, testable acceptance criteria (checkboxes)
- [x] Dependencies between tasks are identified where applicable
- [x] No obvious missing tasks or steps

## Task Readiness

- [x] Tasks are ordered logically (dependencies considered)
- [x] Each task is granular enough to be estimated and completed independently
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers or unresolved ambiguities remain in tasks

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require task updates before `/sp.implement`
