## Prompt

```text
Goal: Implement the document ingestion and preprocessing layer for the RAG agent.
This includes:

cloning the GitHub repo

locating the Markdown files

splitting them into chunks

generating embeddings for chunks (using Claude or embedding model)

returning a Python module that provides these utilities
```

## Response snapshot

The specification for the Document Ingestion and Preprocessing layer for the RAG agent has been created and validated. All checklist items pass.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The specification for the RAG document ingestion and preprocessing layer is complete.
- 🧪 Tests: Specification Quality Checklist passed.
- 📁 Files: specs/001-rag-doc-ingestion/spec.md, specs/001-rag-doc-ingestion/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: The feature is ready for planning using `/sp.plan`.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created the spec and addressed a missing section based on checklist validation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial `Write` to spec.md failed without a preceding `Read`. Addressed by performing a `Read` first.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All spec quality checklist items passed after correction.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `Read` is always performed before `Write` for files that are generated by scripts but then subsequently edited.
