## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Deploy Docusaurus Book (Priority: P1)

As a book owner, I want to deploy my Docusaurus book to GitHub Pages so that it is publicly accessible and can be used for future integrations.

**Why this priority**: This is the core requirement and provides the foundational public accessibility for the book. Without this, no other features can be built on a stable public site.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the Docusaurus book is accessible at the specified GitHub Pages URL after a successful GitHub Actions deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Docusaurus project in the `front-end` folder of the `amnaMahmoodObs/robotics-book` GitHub repository, **When** the necessary configuration and GitHub Actions workflow are set up and pushed to the `main` branch, **Then** the book is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages.
2. **Given** a successful deployment, **When** navigating to `https://amnamahmoodobs.github.io/robotics-book/`, **Then** the Docusaurus book content is displayed correctly.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST be configured to deploy the Docusaurus book from the `front-end` folder to GitHub Pages.
- **FR-002**: The Docusaurus configuration (`docusaurus.config.js` or similar) MUST be updated with the correct `baseUrl` and `projectName` for GitHub Pages.
- **FR-003**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` or similar) MUST be added to automate the build and deployment process.
- **FR-004**: The GitHub Actions workflow MUST trigger on pushes to the `main` branch.
- **FR-005**: The deployed book MUST be accessible at `https://amnamahmoodobs.github.io/robotics-book/`.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Docusaurus Book**: The static site generated by Docusaurus, located in the `front-end` directory.
- **GitHub Repository**: `amnaMahmoodObs/robotics-book`, hosting the Docusaurus source and the deployed GitHub Pages.
- **GitHub Pages**: The hosting service provided by GitHub for static websites.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: The automated process to build and deploy the Docusaurus book.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The Docusaurus book is successfully deployed to GitHub Pages within 15 minutes of a push to the `main` branch.
- **SC-002**: The deployed Docusaurus book is accessible and renders without errors at `https://amnamahmoodobs.github.io/robotics-book/`.
- **SC-003**: All pages and navigation within the deployed Docusaurus book function correctly.
- **SC-004**: Subsequent pushes to the `main` branch automatically trigger a new deployment, updating the GitHub Pages site.
