# API Contracts

This directory is reserved for API contract definitions (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger schemas, GraphQL schemas).

For the "Backend Initialization for RAG Chatbot" feature (`001-rag-backend-init`), API logic and routes are explicitly out of scope for this planning phase. Therefore, no concrete API contracts are defined here at this time.
